	<p>The clock stopped ticking, Forever ago.<br />
	How long have I been up? I don't know.<br />
	I can't get a grip, But I can't let go<br />
	There wasn't anything To hold on to though...<br />
	<br />
	Why can't I see? Why can't I see?<br />
	All the colors that you see?<br />
	Please, Can I be, Please, Can I be<br />
	Colorful and free?<br />
	<br />
	What the hell's going on?!<br />
	Can someone tell me please--<br /> 
	why, I'm switching faster than the channels on TV!<br />
	I'm black, then I'm white! No! Something isn't right!<br />
	My enemy's invisible, I don't know how to fight<br />
	The trembling fear is more than I can take,<br />
	When I'm up against the echo in the mirror<br />
	<br />
	Echo<br />
	<br />
	I'm gonna burn my house down, Into an ugly black.<br />
	I'm gonna run away, Now And never look back<br />
	I'm gonna burn my house down, Into an ugly black.<br />
	I'm gonna run away, Now And never look back<br />
	I'm gonna burn my house down, Into an ugly black.<br />
	I'm gonna run away, Now And never look back<br />
	I'm gonna burn my house down, And never look back.<br />
	And never look back<br />
	<br />
	And never look back<br />
	<br />
	What the hell's going on?!<br />
	Can someone tell me please--<br /> 
	why, I'm switching faster than the channels on TV!<br />
	I'm black, then I'm white! No! Something isn't right!<br />
	My enemy's invisible, I don't know how to fight<br />

	The trembling fear is more than I can take,<br />
	When I'm up against<br />
	The Echo in the mirror</p>
